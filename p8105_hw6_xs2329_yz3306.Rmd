### A. Bar graph of most popular product in each deparment

```{r}
instacart %>%
    group_by(department, product_name) %>%
    summarize(orders = n()) %>%
    group_by(department) %>%
    summarise(most_popular = product_name[which.max(orders)],

```

### B Box plot of the hour of the day the order was placed on across department

```{r}
instacart %>%
  group_by(department) %>%
  mutate(iqr_hr_of_day = IQR(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  ungroup(department) %>% 
  mutate(department = forcats::fct_reorder(department,iqr_hr_of_day)) %>%

  plot_ly(y = ~order_hour_of_day, color = ~department, type = "box",
          colors = "Set1")

```

### C Bar graph number of orders placed during a week 

```{r}

  instacart %>% 
  group_by(department, order_dow) %>%
  filter(department == c("bakery", "deli", "frozen", "produce")) %>%
  summarise(orders = n()) %>%
